# ChineseTag

Module.py can run in the IDE which has a GUI can make the training become easy.
This Chinese tagging system is based on the HMM model and is decoded using the Viterbi algorithm.

P.S. I have already packaged the module with pyinstaller as a module.exe, but the file is too large to be uploaded to github.

The data I use in training comes from the following address,(thanks for the author's sharing) 
And maybe you need to change some code if you want to use other format of data.
