About the function and data format：

If you do not have assembly language programs to run or you want to refer to the assembly language format that this program can accept, I recommend that you can refer to the data in "data" folder.

The program defines two modes：
(1 corresponds to a program with block (2.11) and 2 corresponds to no block (2.9)). 
(If you want to see more details about above information,
please refer to [System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming (3rd Edition)] Chapter 2)

*******************************************************
The assembler is compilable and runs successfully in the Dev-C++ IDE(Version 5.11).
 Some compilers may report errors because they do not support some header files. 

*******************************************************
Note:

The assembler is written in C, but is stored in C++ format. 

Since some C++-specified escape characters are used in this assembler, 
changing the suffix name(e.g.   xxx.cpp change to xxx.c) may cause errors. 

If you want to change the file path and name of the input and output, 
comments have been made in specific lines where they can be changed.

If you have any questions or find errors in running, 
please contact me by Email :)
